Discussion and planning for a LMS in Rock RMS

You are probably looking for the [discussion](https://github.com/Stelagmite/learning-management-system/issues) section.

Hi everyone. Here is a place where we can work together to come up with a minimum viable product (mvp) to create a learning management system (LMS) inside of Rock. This started based on a conversation within a Rock Star Meetup where we discovered that there is a need for an LMS inside of Rock for many churches and it has been something the Spark Team has wanted to do for awhile, but the timing/need/etc hasn't been right. 

The goal of this is to work together as a community to suggest a MVP to Spark and help save time for them. Secondary goal would be to gather some churches that would be interested in contributing to help make it come to core as well.

Thank you to anyone who contributes!
